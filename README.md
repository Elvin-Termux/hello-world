# hello-world
This is for practicing the flow on GitHub.
  This is one of my first nights on GitHub. When I first heard about this GitHub thing probably already six months ago, i was rather skeptical. If people wanted to share their code, why not just -- well, what other good options are there for programmers from all parts of the world to connect and create a large, complex coding project?
  So, that's how I got started on GitHub.
